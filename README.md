## Compile with online PhoneGap Build

Go to [https://build.phonegap.com](PhoneGap Build website) and create an account.

The first time use `grunt mkzip` to create a compressed archive (`app.zip`) and upload it to PhoneGap build website
creating a new app.

Then you can take the App ID and put it into `phonegap-build.yaml` together with your email (see the sample for the format).

Now you can trigger a new build with `grunt onlinebuild`. This does the following tasks:

+ creates a compressed archive
+ uploads it to PhoneGap Build service
+ waits for the compiled app
+ downloads it into `dist/` folder.
